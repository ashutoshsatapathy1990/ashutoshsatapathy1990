Manuals in this website helps beginners to install and configure various tools in the field of Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Parallel Programming, VoIP and Network Communication. These manuals are for learning Purposes only. 

### Server Management

* [**Windows Server 2016 Administration for Beginners**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~cvlsegmentation/cob/)<br>
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.
 
### Parallel Programming

* [**OpenCL for Windows Server 2012 R2: MS VS 2015 Configuration for Nvidia and Intel GPU**](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/)<br>
Code to capture a camera feed, locate a Sudoku grid, find and recognize the numbers, solve it in real time, and overlay the results.

### Deep Learning

* [**Deep Learning in Ubuntu 16.04: TensorFlow, Keras and CNTK Installation**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/boosting-coco/)<br>
Webpage to showcase the results of our publication. It involved a decent amount of JavaScript, D3.js, PHP, and MySQL.
