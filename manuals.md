It all started when my father taught me some notions of Visual Basic, and with the priceless help of the code completion tool (yeah, no Google at that time). Since then, I've been enjoying coding and here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Server Management

* [**Convolutional Oriented Boundaries**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~cvlsegmentation/cob/)<br>
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.
 
### Parallel Programming

* [**OpenCL for Windows Server 2012 R2: MS VS 2015 Configuration for Nvidia and Intel GPU**](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/)<br>
Code to capture a camera feed, locate a Sudoku grid, find and recognize the numbers, solve it in real time, and overlay the results.

### Deep Learning

* [**Deep Learning in Ubuntu 16.04: TensorFlow, Keras and CNTK Installation**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/boosting-coco/)<br>
Webpage to showcase the results of our publication. It involved a decent amount of JavaScript, D3.js, PHP, and MySQL.

* [**Deep Learning in Windows Server 2012 R2: TensorFlow, Keras and CNTK Installation**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/boosting-coco/)<br>

* [**Object detection in Ubuntu 16.04: TensorFlow Object Detection API Installation**](https://graphics.ethz.ch/~perazzif/davis/index.html)<br>
Webpage to showcase the benchmark results of DAVIS and browse results. Again: JavaScript, D3.js, PHP, and MySQL.

### Computer Vision and Image Processing

* [**OpenCV3 for Ubuntu 16.04: CPU and GPU Installation**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/boosting-coco/)<br>
Webpage to showcase the results of our publication. It involved a decent amount of JavaScript, D3.js, PHP, and MySQL.
